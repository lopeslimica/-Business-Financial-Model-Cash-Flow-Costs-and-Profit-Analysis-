**Summary of company**
Hawkens Gingerbread, a UK-based company known for its premium products, seeks to establish a sustainable and profitable model for ginger cultivation in Lincolnshire. By leveraging innovative farming techniques, the company aims to address the challenges of import dependency and carbon emissions while promoting local economic growth. The consultancy team is tasked with delivering a comprehensive feasibility study, enabling Hawkens Gingerbread to make informed decisions about entering the local ginger production market. The ultimate goal is to ensure competitiveness, enhance product quality, and align with sustainability goals.

**Problem Statement**
The United Kingdom relies heavily on imported ginger, which poses challenges such as supply chain disruptions, high costs, and significant carbon emissions. Hawkens Gingerbread aims to explore the feasibility of cultivating ginger locally to mitigate these issues, ensure sustainability, and support the local economy.

**Project Description**
This project evaluates the financial, environmental, and technical feasibility of cultivating ginger in the UK using innovative methods such as polytunnels and vertical farming. The study includes a detailed cost analysis, risk assessments, and pilot project evaluations to compare these farming techniques. The goal is to identify a sustainable approach that minimizes environmental impact, reduces import dependency, and enhances local production capabilities.

**Objectives**
1) Conduct Detailed Cost Analysis and Financial Modelling- Evaluate the financial viability of various farming techniques, including initial investments and long-term profitability.
   
2) Perform Risk Assessment and Mitigation - Identify challenges such as climate constraints, technological dependence, and market acceptance, and propose strategies to mitigate these risks.

3) Implement and Evaluate Pilot Projects - Test and validate the practicality of growing ginger using advanced farming methods.

4) Measure Environmental and Economic Impacts- Assess the carbon footprint, employment creation, and contributions to rural development.

5) Compare Cultivation Methods- Evaluate the costs, yields, and environmental implications of polytunnels versus vertical farming to recommend the optimal approach.

**Learning Outcomes**
1) Understanding advanced agricultural techniques such as polytunnels and vertical farming.
2) Conducting feasibility studies for agribusiness projects.
3) Analyzing market demand and supply chain dependencies.
4) Implementing sustainable practices in agriculture.
5) Identifying risks in agricultural ventures and developing mitigation strategies.
6) Evaluating the economic and environmental impacts of farming innovations.
